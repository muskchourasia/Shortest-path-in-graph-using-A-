# Shortest-path-in-graph-using-A-
Aim: Finding shortest path in graph using A* search algorithm.

In this, program we will ask the user whether he wants to give a graph or use the predefined one. In case of the predefined graph the user will be asked to enter starting and stopping node .If the user wants to give a dynamic input he will have to enter the node name with itâ€™s heuristic value along with starting and stopping node. Then the programme will compute the shortest path between the starting and stopping node using A* search algorithm and print the path and the code will terminate.
